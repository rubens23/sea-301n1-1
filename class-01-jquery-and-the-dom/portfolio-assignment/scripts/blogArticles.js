    body:        '<p>One of the biggest sports stories of the year was the announcement of Kobe Bryants retirement. Many regard him as arguably one of the greatest players in NBA history. A 17-time All-Star, 11-time All-NBA selections, five world championships and an MVP award coming his way in the year 2008. The accolades could go on and on but you get the point.</p><p><img src="kobe.jpg" class="pull-right" > And now at the end of this NBA season, Kobe Bryant will be gone and the only thing left to remember him by are the memories. It\'s Amazing how long its been yet it seems like it was just yesterday that this skinny kid frim Philadelphia was drafted by the New Orleans Hornets in 1996 before ultimately ending up in Los Angeles. 20 years its been since he stepped on that draft night stage with no clue about the player that he would become. <br><br> Fast forward to present day, the Lakers stink. And to top it all off Kobe is the worst shooter in the entire league by percentage. Some say its due to the amount of years hes played and the wear and tear on his body. Others look to his old age and many believe you could blame his recent play on the amount of injuries he\'s sustained in the past few years. Whatever the case may be the box office attraction that is Kobe Bryant has not diminished, in fact, it has increased. Stadiums around the country are sold out any time the Lakers come to town so that fans could get one last look at The Mamba. Most of his career, Kobe has been hated anywhere besides Los Angeles (naturally). But the hate directed towards this man came out of jealousy, anger, frustration, and most importantly, respect. Fans all over the country despised Kobe when he came to play against their teams because he was just that good. They hoped and hoped that their own star players would someday become good enough to be able to challenge Kobes greatness and beat him. Rarely has that worked, especially in playoff contests. They hated, but respected him because the amount of time and energy he put in to strengthen his game and become the best player he could possibly be is unparalelled. <br><br> Nowadays, Kobe gets more cheers than jeers. Since everyone knows that he is retireing, fans seem to be confused as to what they would like to see most. Their team win, or Kobe go off for 30 or 40 points? On some nights they might see a Kobe show but they would beat the Lakers all at the same time, which would be ideal. But Kobe spent most of the first half of the season shooting bricks. His legs were not under him, and his body was not used to the high level of play that an NBA game requires after missing almost two full seasons. He has started coming into his own with a group of young players around him leading the show. But when Kobe has a chance, he still shows flashes of that same old kobe that everyone has been accustomed to.  </p>'
